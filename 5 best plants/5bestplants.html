<p align="center">If you’re eyeing those vine-y or trailing plants, 
you’re in luck! The Pothos is another indoor plant that is quite easy to take care of. While it starts off pretty small, 
you may need to repot this plant just because it grows quite quickly. 
<br>
<br>
You can place your Pothos in almost any part of your room as it can survive in moderate indoor light, and low light conditions.

<p align="center">
Before you buy an aloe, note that you’ll need a location that offers bright, 
indirect sunlight. However, the plant doesn’t appreciate sustained direct sunlight, 
as this tends to dry out the plant too much and turn its leaves yellow, 
rendering them subpar for use.
<br>
<br>Keep them watering down to a minimum! 
Aloe Vera plants like their soil pretty dry before they go through another round of watering.
<br>

If you love Aloe Vera for its healing properties, 
then you'll love it even more after we tell you it’s incredibly easy to take care of.  </p>
